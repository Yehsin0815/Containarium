// Startup-wiring guards for the metrics-export path (#1077, finding 1).
//
// The behaviour of the resume path is already well covered:
// TestStartMetricsExportIfEnabled_ResumesFromPersistedConfig,
// TestMetricsExport_LateStoreWiring_NotCachedAsDisabled (#1070) and
// TestCurrentExportLabels / ..._ResumeCapturesLiveIdentity (#1080) all
// pin what ContainerServer does *given* the calls.
//
// None of them can catch the failure #1077 was actually filed about: a
// wiring call silently disappearing from dual_server.go. That is not
// hypothetical — #1075 shipped with a comment claiming a call existed at
// a call site where it did not, and no test noticed, because the tests
// hand-injected the dependency instead of exercising the real startup
// path.
//
// NewDualServer needs a database, an incus connection and a filled
// DualServerConfig, so constructing one in a unit test is not realistic.
// These tests assert over the parsed AST of dual_server.go instead. That
// is a narrow tool and deliberately so: it answers exactly one question
// — is the call still there, in the right function — which is the whole
// of the regression class. It reads the AST rather than matching text,
// so reformatting, renamed locals and moved comments do not disturb it.

// dualServerFuncCalls returns the method names called inside the named
// top-level function of dual_server.go, in source order.
