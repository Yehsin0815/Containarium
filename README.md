# Containarium — Agent Runtime

> **Open-source agent runtime** · SSH-native isolation · eBPF egress policy · Kubernetes + LXC · MCP-native CLI · GPU passthrough

**The open-source, self-hostable agent runtime for AI agents.**
Each agent gets a persistent, SSH-reachable box with per-tenant network isolation — no kube-apiserver token, no host access, no cross-tenant leakage.

Bring your own agent — Cursor, Claude Code, OpenCode, your own MCP client.
We run the box.

```
agent: "create me a sandbox called 'blog'"           → containarium create
agent: "wire up SSH so I can reach it"               → containarium ssh-config sync
agent: "install Caddy on :8080 inside the box"       → shell_exec (via agent-box MCP)
agent: "expose that on blog.example.com"             → containarium expose-port

curl https://blog.example.com → hello world
```

## Why an agent runtime?

AI agents are increasingly the primary user of dev infrastructure. They
want to build, install, deploy, and verify — not on the human's laptop
(too noisy, too risky, too local) but on a persistent, isolated runtime that's:

- **Persistent**: state survives between agent runs.
- **Isolated**: a misbehaving install doesn't touch your machine or your cluster.
- **Real**: a full Linux environment with `systemd`, real networking,
  and the ability to host things on the open internet.
- **Driven by structured tools**: not by an agent typing commands into a
  TTY hoping nothing scrolls off-screen, but by MCP — typed,
  bounded, safe.
- **Blast-radius-bounded**: the agent holds an SSH key, not a
  kube-apiserver token. It can't reach the cluster control plane, the
  host OS, or other tenants' boxes.

That's the runtime Containarium gives you. It runs as a self-hosted
platform on LXC or Kubernetes, exposes its admin surface over MCP, and
ships a second MCP server that lives *inside* the box so the agent can
`shell_exec` and edit files directly.

You bring the agent. We run the box.

---

## Quick start

One path, three steps, with a check at the end of each. You're done when a
box exists, `ssh alice` gets you a shell in it, and your agent can run
commands inside it.

**Before you start:** a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 VM you can `sudo` on (see
[System requirements](#system-requirements)). You need Containarium
**v0.96.0 or later**; the installer fetches the latest release. `sudo` is
only needed to run the installer and to read the admin token. Every other
command runs as your normal user and goes through the daemon's API.

### 1. Install, then create your first box

On the VM:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://containarium.dev/install.sh | sudo bash
```

✅ **Check:** the daemon is running and the CLI is on your `PATH`.

```bash
systemctl is-active containarium   # → active
containarium version               # → v0.96.0 or later
```

Point the CLI at the local daemon, using the admin token the installer
saved, and create a box called `alice`:

<!-- Flip to the installer's one-liner (`… | sudo bash -s -- --quickstart alice`)
     once the published installer is confirmed to support it (#2244). -->

```bash
export CONTAINARIUM_HTTP=true
export CONTAINARIUM_SERVER=http://localhost:8080
export CONTAINARIUM_TOKEN="$(sudo cat /etc/containarium/admin.token)"

containarium quickstart alice
```

`quickstart` creates the box, reuses your `~/.ssh` key or generates a
managed one (`~/.ssh/containarium_ed25519`), writes
`~/.containarium/ssh_config`, adds the single
`Include ~/.containarium/ssh_config` line to `~/.ssh/config`, and wires
the box into your agent's MCP config (Claude Code by default). It's safe
to run again, including to repair an older quickstart's MCP command.

✅ **Check:** `quickstart` ends with `✓ quickstart complete`, and the box is
listed as running.

```bash
containarium list   # → a row for alice-container, STATUS running
```

### 2. Connect to the box

Choose the variant that matches where you're typing.

**Variant A: on the VM.** This works on a fresh install. Step 1 already
wrote the config. Re-sync whenever your boxes change:

```bash
containarium ssh-config sync --identity ~/.ssh/containarium_ed25519
# leave out --identity if quickstart reused your own ~/.ssh key
```

✅ **Check:**

```bash
ssh alice hostname   # → alice-container
```

**Variant B: from your laptop. Needs a sentinel or `--ssh-host`.** A fresh
single-VM install doesn't advertise a public SSH host. A laptop-side sync
would therefore write the box's private bridge IP, and `ssh alice` couldn't
connect. Use this variant when your deployment has a
[sentinel](#sentinel--sshpiper--caddy--proxy-protocol) or the daemon runs
with `--ssh-host`. Making this work out of the box is tracked in
[#2249](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/issues/2249).

```bash
# On your laptop: install the client only.
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/footprintai/containarium/main/hacks/install-cli.sh | sudo bash

# Reach the daemon's API through an SSH tunnel to the VM.
ssh -fN -L 8080:localhost:8080 <you>@<vm-host>
export CONTAINARIUM_HTTP=true
export CONTAINARIUM_SERVER=http://localhost:8080
export CONTAINARIUM_TOKEN="$(ssh <you>@<vm-host> sudo cat /etc/containarium/admin.token)"

# Leave out --sentinel when the daemon runs with --ssh-host.
containarium ssh-config sync --sentinel <sentinel-host>
```

Then make `Include ~/.containarium/ssh_config` the first line of your
laptop's `~/.ssh/config`. Your laptop's public key also has to be on the box
(see `containarium collaborator add --help`).

✅ **Check:**

```bash
containarium ssh-config show --sentinel <sentinel-host> | grep '^Host '   # → Host alice
```

### 3. Wire your agent to the box

Your agent reaches the box through `agent-box`, an MCP server that runs
inside it. `code install` puts it there, along with Claude Code. Run it on
the VM, in the same shell as step 1:

```bash
containarium code install alice
```

✅ **Check:** the install prints `agent-box installed at …/.local/bin/agent-box`,
and the binary is there:

```bash
ssh alice 'test -x ~/.local/bin/agent-box && echo agent-box ready'   # → agent-box ready
```

On the machine where your agent runs, `quickstart` wires the MCP config
automatically. Step 1 already did this for Claude Code on the VM. If your
agent runs on your laptop, run this there using the API connection from
step 2; it reuses the existing box:

```bash
containarium quickstart alice --agent claude
# For Gemini or Codex, use --agent gemini or --agent codex instead.
```

For Cursor, add the server to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` manually:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "containarium-box": {
      "command": "ssh",
      "args": ["alice", "sh -c 'PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH\" exec agent-box'"]
    }
  }
}
```

This command sets the box's `PATH` for non-interactive SSH and supports
both user-level and system-wide installs of `agent-box`.

✅ **Check:** your agent lists `containarium-box` as a connected MCP server
(in Claude Code, `claude mcp list`). Asking it to *"run `uname -a` in the
box"* returns a Linux kernel line from `alice-container`. It now has
`shell_exec`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `list_directory`, `move_file` and
`delete_file` inside the box.

**That's your first box.** Next:
[run the agent on the box](#run-the-agent-on-the-box) ·
[run pi inside the box](#run-pi-inside-the-box) ·
[put the box on a public hostname](#put-the-box-on-a-public-hostname) ·
[build a site in one command](#build-a-site-in-one-command).

---

## After your first box

### Run the agent on the box

`code install` (step 3) already put Claude Code on the box. It installs
**no credential**: sign-in goes through Anthropic's own flow, never through
us. Choose one of these, once:

```bash
# interactive: sign in inside the box (device code)
ssh alice
claude

# or headless: your own key in the "env" block of ~/.claude/settings.json on the box
#   {"env": {"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "<your key>"}}
```

Then:

```bash
containarium code run alice --prompt "add a health endpoint and run the tests"
```

`code run` streams output to your terminal as it's produced, but it isn't a
pipe. The run is detached on the box and its output is captured to a log;
your terminal is a *resumable reader* over that log. Close your laptop, lose
wifi, press Ctrl-C: the run keeps going, and `containarium code attach alice`
picks the stream back up **byte-exact**, with nothing missing and nothing
repeated.

```bash
containarium code attach alice   # reconnect; replays what you missed
containarium code status alice   # liveness, and the exit code once it finishes
containarium code stop alice     # reap it; the log stays readable
```

The difference from the MCP wiring in step 3 is where the agent runs. There,
the agent is on your machine and reaches into the box. Here, the agent *is*
on the box, so the work survives your machine sleeping, and the tests run
next to the code instead of over a network hop.

### Run pi inside the box

If your agent has no MCP client, run it *inside* the box instead. See
[docs/integrations/pi.md](docs/integrations/pi.md) for the
[pi](https://pi.dev) walkthrough (installs, keys, code sync, sessions).

### Put the box on a public hostname

```bash
containarium expose-port alice \
  --container-port 8080 \
  --domain blog.example.com
```

Caddy on the sentinel terminates TLS for `blog.example.com` and forwards to
`alice-container:8080`. `curl https://blog.example.com` then hits whatever
`alice` is serving on port 8080.

### Build a site in one command

Run from your laptop against a server you can reach (see step 2, variant B),
`quickstart` does steps 1–3 in one go: it creates the box and wires SSH and
your agent (`claude`, `gemini` or `codex`). With `--prompt` it also exposes
`--domain` and launches your local agent on the build:

```bash
containarium quickstart alice --server <your-server> \
  --prompt "a coffee-shop landing page" --domain coffee.example.com
```

`containarium quickstart --help` lists every option.

---

## The four primitives

Every action in Containarium has a CLI verb (canonical) AND an MCP tool
(thin wrapper that delegates to the same Go function). See
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the convention.

### `agent-box` — in-the-box MCP server

Runs inside every container. Reached over stdio (typically wrapped by
SSH on the client side). Exposes Linux-native operations:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `shell_exec` | Run a shell command, capture stdout/stderr/exit, bounded by timeout (default 30s, max 10min) and 256 KiB output cap |
| `read_file` | Byte range OR `head=N` lines OR `tail=N` lines |
| `write_file` | Atomic write with `mkdirp` (temp + rename) |
| `list_directory` | Type/size/mtime, hidden filtering |
| `move_file` | Atomic rename with `mkdirp` on destination |
| `delete_file` | Single-file remove (refuses directories so recursive deletes go via `shell_exec` where blast radius is explicit) |

Resources (read-only data the agent fetches via MCP `resources/read`):

| URI | What it returns |
|---|---|
| `containarium://ci-context` | JSON metadata about the current CI run (PR number, commit SHA, failing test, etc.) when the box was kept alive by the FootprintAI/containarium-run GitHub Action after a failed CI run. Returns `{"available": false}` on non-CI boxes so callers never have to special-case errors. |
| `containarium://ci-prompt` | Static markdown playbook telling agents how to debug a failing CI run inside this box (what to read first, how to iterate, what not to do). Same body on every box; pair with `ci-context` for the per-run data. |

Optional sandbox: when `AGENTBOX_ROOT` is set, every file-ops path is
resolved against that root with a boundary-aware prefix check. Default
unset = no constraint. See
[`internal/agentbox/`](internal/agentbox/) for the Go implementation.

### `mcp-server` — platform MCP server

Runs on the host. Exposes outside-the-box admin operations:
`create_container`, `list_containers`, `delete_container`,
`start_container`, `stop_container`, `expose_port`, `get_metrics`,
`get_system_info`. See [`cmd/mcp-server/`](cmd/mcp-server/).

### `containarium` CLI

Same surface as the platform MCP, plus deeper administration. Top-level
verbs:

```
containarium create             Create a new container
containarium code               Run a coding agent ON a box (install / run / attach / status / stop)
containarium list               List all containers
containarium delete             Delete a container
containarium expose-port        Expose container:port on a public hostname
containarium ssh-config         Generate self-contained ssh_config
containarium route              Manage proxy routes (low-level)
containarium passthrough        Manage TCP/UDP passthrough rules (local iptables)
containarium passthrough-route  Manage TCP/UDP passthrough routes (daemon API)
containarium token              Issue JWT tokens for the API
containarium info               System info
containarium version            Print version
```

Run `containarium <verb> --help` for full options.

### Sentinel — sshpiper + Caddy + PROXY-protocol

The sentinel is a tiny always-on VM (e2-micro on GCP free tier works)
that:

- Receives SSH on port 22 (sshpiper routes to the right backend by
  username).
- Receives HTTPS on 443 (Caddy with TLS-passthrough or
  PROXY-protocol-aware forwarding to backend Caddy).
- Survives spot-VM termination on the backend with a maintenance page.
- Holds the static IP / DNS A-record so backends can be ephemeral.

See [docs/SENTINEL-DESIGN.md](docs/SENTINEL-DESIGN.md) for the full
design.

A single sentinel can front multiple backend VMs — a "pool" — and a
single deployment can run multiple pools (each isolated). See
[docs/MULTI-POOL.md](docs/MULTI-POOL.md).

## How it's different

### vs. SaaS-only sandboxes (e2b, Modal, Replit)

These give you sandboxes for AI agents, but only as hosted SaaS:

- **Self-hostability**: Containarium runs on your own infrastructure
  (a $5 VM, your homelab, your enterprise data center). e2b, Modal,
  and Replit are SaaS-only — your code, your data, and your customers
  go through their compute.
- **License**: Apache 2.0, no CLA. Fork it, sell it, run it.
- **Surface**: full Linux containers with `systemd`, real network
  namespaces, GPU passthrough. Not a process-per-call sandbox.
- **Transport**: MCP-native from day one, not a custom SDK with MCP
  bolted on.

### vs. Docker AI Sandboxes (`sbx`)

Docker's `sbx run claude` and Containarium both call themselves
"AI sandboxes," but they sit on opposite ends of the same spectrum:

- **Locality**: `sbx` runs the sandbox on the developer's laptop
  (microVM, host-isolation). Containarium runs the sandbox on a VM
  you host (LXC, multi-tenant, public-internet reachable via the
  sentinel).
- **Persistence**: `sbx` is session-shaped (workspace mount, no
  documented "give me a box that survives reboot and has a
  hostname"). Containarium containers persist indefinitely, with
  ZFS snapshots and 30-day retention.
- **Public reach**: `containarium expose-port alice --domain
  blog.example.com` is one verb. `sbx` is laptop-local; no
  public-hostname story.
- **Agent surface**: `sbx` is CLI-first (`sbx run <agent>`).
  Containarium is MCP-native — two MCP servers (in-the-box
  `agent-box` + platform `mcp-server`) plus the same surface via
  CLI, SSH, REST/gRPC, and a web UI.
- **License**: `sbx` CLI is free; team policy (Docker Admin Console)
  is a paid subscription. Containarium is Apache 2.0 — including
  the audit log, RBAC, KMS integrations, and everything else on
  this page.

If you're stopping an agent from `rm -rf`-ing the laptop it's
running on, `sbx` is the lighter tool. If you're giving your agent
(or your customer's agent) a persistent Linux box on the public
internet, Containarium is the shape.

### vs. OSS Kubernetes agent runtimes (agent-sandbox, OpenShell)

[`kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox)
and [`NVIDIA/OpenShell`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell) are the
closest open-source peers on Kubernetes:

- **SSH-native vs. exec-based**: both agent-sandbox and OpenShell reach
  the sandbox via `kubectl exec` or a proprietary client, which requires
  the agent to hold a kube-apiserver token or cluster credentials.
  Containarium reaches the pod over SSH through sshpiper — the agent has
  no path to the cluster control plane at all.
- **MCP-native**: agent-sandbox and OpenShell expose REST APIs or custom
  SDKs. Containarium's `agent-box` MCP server runs *inside* the box,
  reachable over SSH stdio — any MCP-speaking agent (Claude Code, Cursor,
  OpenCode) works with zero client library.
- **LXC + K8s, one CLI**: Containarium runs on either Incus/LXC or
  Kubernetes behind the same `containarium` CLI and `--runtime` flag. You
  switch backends without changing anything for the agent.
- **eBPF egress policy**: Containarium enforces per-tenant egress
  allowlists at the kernel level via TC_INGRESS eBPF programs.
  agent-sandbox has NetworkPolicy; OpenShell has eBPF but is
  NVIDIA-stack-specific. Neither offers a portable, per-tenant eBPF
  allowlist across LXC and K8s backends.

### vs. dev environment platforms (Codespaces, Gitpod, Coder)

Those are persistent IDEs. Containarium is a persistent **box** —
agent-driven, not developer-driven, no IDE assumption, SSH-as-the-API:

- Containarium environments are reached by SSH and MCP. Any IDE works
  (Vim, JetBrains Remote, VS Code Remote, Cursor's remote dev — your
  call).
- Cost: no per-hour billing in the OSS path. Self-host costs are just
  your underlying VM.
- Persistence: containers survive indefinitely; Codespaces auto-delete
  after inactivity.

### vs. application container platforms (Docker, Kubernetes)

LXC is a **system** container, not an application container. Each
container has `systemd`, a real init, real users, real package managers,
real `sudo`. You can run Docker *inside* a Containarium container; the
reverse isn't really a thing.

If your agent is going to `apt install` half a Linux distro, edit
config files in `/etc`, run a database, and reboot — LXC is the right
shape. If your agent runs a single Python process, Docker or Modal is
fine.

It isn't either/or: Containarium can run a box *as a pod* in a
Kubernetes cluster you already operate — same SSH-native agent contract,
no kube-apiserver token in the agent's hands. Switch with
`--runtime=k8s`. See the **Kubernetes backend** section below.

---

## What's in the box

Beyond the agent-native primitives, Containarium ships:

### Multi-OS

- **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** (default)
- **Rocky Linux 9** (dev/test)
- **RHEL 9** (production)
- **Windows Server VMs** via QEMU/KVM with RDP — see
  [docs/WINDOWS-VM-SETUP.md](docs/WINDOWS-VM-SETUP.md)

### GPU passthrough

For ML/AI agent workflows. Works with NVIDIA RTX 3090, RTX 4090, and
similar. PCI-level passthrough so the container sees the GPU directly.
Tested on bare-metal GPU nodes connected to the sentinel via tunnel.

### Multi-backend

A single sentinel can front:

- **GCP spot VMs**: cost-effective cloud backends with auto-recovery
  on preemption.
- **Bare-metal GPU nodes**: any Linux box you can SSH to; reaches the
  sentinel via outbound tunnel.
- **Windows VMs**: live alongside Linux backends.

All containers from all backends appear in a single unified API.

### Kubernetes backend (experimental)

Beyond the LXC/Incus backend, Containarium can run a box as a **pod in a
Kubernetes cluster you already operate** — reached over SSH exactly like
an LXC box, so an agent can't tell which substrate it landed on. The
daemon reconciles a per-tenant namespace + StatefulSet + headless Service
+ default-deny NetworkPolicy, and programs the sshpiper gateway (the
`Pipe` CRD) so `ssh <tenant>@<gateway>` routes to the right pod.

The pitch isn't "another way to run pods" — it's giving an agent a
hardened, SSH-native foothold in your cluster **without handing it a
kube-apiserver token**: the box runs with `automountServiceAccountToken:
false` and satisfies the `restricted` Pod Security profile. Compare this
to `kubectl exec`-based runtimes where the agent necessarily holds cluster
credentials.

**Runtime selection** (no recompile needed):

```bash
# LXC/Incus (default)
containariumd daemon

# Kubernetes — uses in-cluster config or KUBECONFIG
CONTAINARIUM_RUNTIME=k8s containariumd daemon
# or
containariumd daemon --runtime=k8s
```

Both backends share the same CLI, MCP tools, JWT auth, and REST/gRPC API.
GPU passthrough is supported on K8s via `nvidia.com/gpu` resource limits.
Local bring-up takes under 5 minutes with `kind` — see
[docs/KIND-QUICKSTART.md](docs/KIND-QUICKSTART.md).

### Web UI

A basic dashboard at `/webui/` for users who'd rather not type CLI:
container list, lifecycle controls, metrics, browser-based terminal.
Polished UI is intentionally a cloud-product concern — the OSS web UI
is functional, not opinionated.

### Persistent storage (ZFS)

Containers survive VM restarts and spot termination. ZFS handles
compression, snapshots (daily by default, 30-day retention), and
checksums.

### Sentinel HA

The sentinel itself is e2-micro (free tier). It:

- Detects spot preemption in ~10s, serves a maintenance page.
- Restarts spot VMs automatically (~85s total recovery).
- Holds the static IP, so DNS doesn't change as backends rotate.

### Monitoring & observability

VictoriaMetrics + Grafana auto-provisioned. Per-container CPU,
memory, disk, network. Alerting via webhooks. SSH audit logs per
user (LXC backend; the Kubernetes backend records control-plane API
audit but not in-box SSH sessions — see #1189).

### Security primitives

- **Unprivileged LXC containers**: container root ≠ host root.
- **Per-user proxy accounts**: `/usr/sbin/nologin` on the sentinel,
  users can only proxy through to their container.
- **fail2ban per-user**: an attack on Alice's account doesn't ban
  Bob.
- **ClamAV + Trivy** scanning across all backends.
- **AppArmor profiles** per container.
- **AGENTBOX_ROOT sandbox** to constrain agent-box file ops at runtime.

**Zero-trust controls** (rolled out across the v0.17 → unreleased line; see [`docs/security/OPERATOR-SECURITY-RUNBOOK.md`](docs/security/OPERATOR-SECURITY-RUNBOOK.md)):

- **JWT with `iss` / `aud` / `jti` / `tt` / `scopes`**: 32-byte minimum
  secret enforced at startup; refresh tokens are single-use; jti-based
  revocation; per-tool MCP scopes propagate to server-side gates.
- **Admin RBAC + per-container ownership** on the API surface; cluster
  ops admin-only, container ops owner-only.
- **KMS envelope encryption for tenant secrets** (Vault Transit or GCP
  Cloud KMS), with a migration tool and master-key retirement gate.
- **tmpfs `--delivery=file`** for secrets that shouldn't be visible in
  `/proc/<pid>/environ`.
- **Audit log with SHA-256 hash chain** + `containarium audit verify`
  to detect tampering.
- **Image-registry allowlist + pre-pull simplestreams digest
  verification + post-pull `volatile.base_image` defense-in-depth**
  for supply-chain hardening.
- **`SECURITY.md`** with a 90-day coordinated-disclosure window;
  `gosec` / `govulncheck` / `trivy` running in CI.

## CLI reference (essentials)

### Container lifecycle

```bash
# Create (Ubuntu 24.04, default)
containarium create alice --ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Create with options
containarium create ml-dev \
  --ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub \
  --gpu 0 \
  --stack gpu \
  --memory 16GB \
  --cpu 4

# Lifecycle
containarium list
containarium info
containarium wake alice     # start a stopped box
containarium sleep alice    # stop it
containarium delete alice
```

### Networking

```bash
# Expose a container port on a public hostname
containarium expose-port alice \
  --container-port 8080 \
  --domain blog.example.com

# Lower-level route management
containarium route add api.example.com --target 10.0.3.42:3000
containarium route list
containarium route delete api.example.com

# Raw TCP/UDP passthrough via local iptables (host running the CLI only)
containarium passthrough add --port 50051 \
  --target-ip 10.0.3.150 --target-port 50051

# Raw TCP/UDP passthrough via the daemon API (works against a remote box)
containarium passthrough-route add --port 9443 \
  --target-ip 10.0.3.150 --target-port 50051 --server <host:port>
containarium passthrough-route list --server <host:port>
containarium passthrough-route remove --port 9443 --server <host:port>
```

### SSH config

```bash
# Print to stdout (preview)
containarium ssh-config show

# Write to ~/.containarium/ssh_config (one-line `Include` to wire in)
containarium ssh-config sync
containarium ssh-config sync --sentinel sentinel.example.com  # via sentinel
containarium ssh-config sync --identity ~/.ssh/containarium_ed25519

# From a client machine, against a remote server (the bare form above
# only reaches a local Incus socket)
containarium ssh-config sync --http --server <host:port>
```

### Authentication

```bash
# Issue an access + refresh pair (CLI-only; never exposed via API).
# Access tokens are short-lived (default 15 min) and authenticate the
# API. Refresh tokens are long-lived and single-use — exchange via
# POST /v1/tokens/refresh for a new pair.
containarium token generate \
  --username admin \
  --roles admin \
  --secret-file /etc/containarium/jwt.secret

# Use the access token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <access-token>" http://localhost:8080/v1/containers

# Inspect a token's claims (jti, scopes, expiry, validation)
containarium token inspect <token> --secret-file /etc/containarium/jwt.secret

# Revoke a leaked token by jti (idempotent; reads from `audit query`
# or `token inspect`)
containarium token revoke <jti> --reason "leak_2026_05_22"
containarium token list-revoked

# Mint a least-privilege token for an agent with only the scopes it
# needs — server-side gates enforce this even if the agent ignores
# the filter.
containarium token generate \
  --username alice-agent \
  --scopes containers:read,containers:write \
  --secret-file /etc/containarium/jwt.secret
```

See [`docs/security/OPERATOR-SECURITY-RUNBOOK.md`](docs/security/OPERATOR-SECURITY-RUNBOOK.md)
for the full token lifecycle, leak-response playbook, and the agent
least-privilege scope catalog.

## Deployment

### Two binaries: `containarium` vs `containariumd`

Same convention as `docker`/`dockerd` or `incus`/`incusd`: `containarium`
is the CLI you run from your laptop (`create`, `list`, `ssh-config`,
`expose-port`, …); `containariumd` is what runs *on the host* — the
daemon, the sentinel, and every on-host admin verb (`daemon`,
`sentinel`, `service install`, `sync-accounts`, `pool join`, `node`,
`hosting`, `recover`, `doctor`). Install `containarium` wherever you
want to drive the platform from (your laptop, a jump box); install
`containariumd` on every host that runs the daemon or sentinel itself.
A compat symlink (`/usr/local/bin/containarium -> containariumd`) keeps
existing hosts and scripts that still invoke `containarium <daemon verb>`
working during the rollout.

### Manual install (recommended for getting started)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://containarium.dev/install.sh | sudo bash
```

See [`hacks/README.md`](hacks/README.md) for what the script does.

### Terraform (recommended for production)

```bash
cd terraform/gce
cp examples/single-server-spot.tfvars terraform.tfvars
vim terraform.tfvars   # set project_id, admin_ssh_keys, allowed_ssh_sources
terraform init
terraform apply
```

See [`terraform/gce/README.md`](terraform/gce/README.md) for variables.

### System requirements

- **Host OS**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS or later (containers can be any
  supported OS).
- **Incus 6.19+** required for Docker-in-LXC support. Ubuntu 24.04's
  default repos ship 6.0.0 which has an AppArmor bug
  ([CVE-2025-52881](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-52881));
  use the [Zabbly Incus repository](https://pkgs.zabbly.com/) for
  current builds.
- **ZFS kernel module** (for disk quotas).
- Kernel modules: `overlay`, `br_netfilter`, `nf_nat` (Docker in
  containers needs these).

```bash
# Quick Incus install via Zabbly
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.zabbly.com/key.asc | \
  sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/zabbly-incus.gpg
echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/zabbly-incus.gpg] \
  https://pkgs.zabbly.com/incus/stable noble main' | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zabbly-incus-stable.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install incus incus-tools incus-client
incus --version  # 6.19 or later
```

## API

Containarium exposes:

- **REST API** at `http://localhost:8080` (gRPC-gateway over the gRPC
  service, JWT auth)
- **gRPC** at `:50051` (mTLS, primarily used by the CLI)
- **Two MCP servers**: `mcp-server` (platform) and `agent-box`
  (in-the-box)

OpenAPI / Swagger UI at
`http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/`.

Token-issuance is **CLI-only** by design; the daemon does not have an
"issue token via API" endpoint, because if it did, anyone with API
access could mint admin tokens.

---

## Hardening notes

### SSH key hygiene

- Each user gets their own keypair. **Never** share keys between users
  — sharing breaks revocation, audit, and per-user fail2ban.
- The same key can authenticate to both the sentinel proxy account and
  the container. That's the supported flow: simpler for users, no
  security loss because the proxy account is `nologin` and only routes
  through.
- To rotate: user generates a new key, admin replaces the
  `authorized_keys` content in the container.

### Agent-box sandbox

If you're running an untrusted agent, set `AGENTBOX_ROOT` to a project
directory:

```bash
# In the container
export AGENTBOX_ROOT=/srv/project
agent-box   # all file ops now constrained to /srv/project
```

`shell_exec` is intentionally not constrained beyond the LXC container
boundary itself — by design, that's the tool's contract. If you need
tighter isolation, run agent-box in a more restrictive container (e.g.
nested LXC, or chroot the user account further).

### Network

- Backend VMs have **no public IP** by default; they reach out via
  Cloud NAT and accept inbound only via sshpiper.
- Sentinel allowlist: configure `allowed_ssh_sources` in Terraform
  (or firewall rules manually) to lock down who can hit port 22.

## Comparison FAQ

**Why not Docker / Podman?**
Docker is for application containers. Containarium uses LXC system
containers — full Linux OS per container, real `systemd`, native SSH,
Docker-in-LXC works, persistent filesystem. If your agent will
`apt install` and reboot, you want LXC.

**Why not Kubernetes?**
K8s orchestrates application containers across nodes — that's the
infrastructure layer. Containarium is the agent runtime that runs *on
top of* Kubernetes (or LXC), giving each agent a persistent, SSH-native
box without handing it cluster credentials. If you're already on K8s,
run `containariumd daemon --runtime=k8s` and use your existing cluster as
the backend. See the [Kubernetes backend](#kubernetes-backend-experimental)
section and [docs/KIND-QUICKSTART.md](docs/KIND-QUICKSTART.md).

**Why not Vagrant?**
Vagrant orchestrates VMs on a developer's local machine. Containarium
hosts environments on shared remote infrastructure for many agents.

**Why not Dev Containers / VS Code Remote Containers?**
Dev Containers are project-scoped, IDE-coupled, single-developer.
Containarium gives many users (or many of one user's agents) their own
persistent boxes on shared infrastructure, IDE-agnostic.

**Why not Codespaces / Gitpod?**
Browser-IDE-as-a-Service, per-hour billed, vendor-locked. Containarium
is self-hosted, persistent, SSH/MCP-based, no per-hour billing in OSS.

**Why not e2b / Modal / Daytona?**
Closest peers — sandboxes for AI agents. They're SaaS-only and
typically optimize for short-lived, process-per-call execution.
Containarium is self-hostable, MCP-native, and gives you full
persistent Linux boxes. Pick e2b if you want hosted-only and
ephemeral; pick Containarium if you want self-hosted, persistent,
and your data on your infra.

**Why LXC at all?**
- Each container runs a full Linux OS with `systemd`.
- SSH access is first-class.
- Docker-in-LXC works (vs. fragile Docker-in-Docker).
- Real persistent filesystem, real users, real `sudo`.
- "Feels like a VM" for the agent — same surface area as a managed
  cloud VM, fraction of the resource cost.

---

## Use cases

- **AI-agent sandboxes** (the lead): Cursor, Claude Code, Cline,
  OpenCode, custom agents — all reach the same MCP surface.
- **Shared developer environments**: many developers, one host, SSH
  jump server with per-user isolation.
- **ML / GPU experimentation**: GPU passthrough into LXC.
- **Education, bootcamps, workshops**: per-student isolated Linux
  with no per-student VM.
- **CI / build infrastructure**: long-lived build hosts that keep
  caches warm across runs.
- **Demo / testing infrastructure**: spin up a real Linux env, test,
  tear down.

## In the wild

Where Containarium has been demonstrated live:

- **2026-08 — COSCUP, Taipei.** *An SSH-native agent runtime, built
  because our hardware was sitting idle* — where utilisation goes on AI
  and VM fleets, why one VM per developer stopped paying for itself, and
  how LXC + sshpiper + persistent disk became Containarium.
  [Slides](https://containarium.dev/talks/coscup2026).
- **2026-06-04 — AI Agent Night, Taipei.** When the grand-prize
  giveaway (a custom vibe-keyboard) hit a snag — the event had no way
  to run the lucky draw — we fired up Containarium and vibe-coded a
  lucky-draw picker on the spot to save the giveaway. Still live:
  [lucky-draw.demo.containarium.dev](https://lucky-draw.demo.containarium.dev/).

## Status

- **Production-deployed** on GCP (multi-region) and bare-metal GPU
  nodes.
- **APIs are stable** (protobuf-defined with gRPC-gateway).
- **Apache 2.0**, no CLA, accepting community PRs.
- Active maintenance: see commit history on `main` and recent
  releases.

---

## Roadmap

- **Shipped (2026-06)**: **[Kubernetes backend](#kubernetes-backend-experimental)**
  — run a box as a pod in a cluster you operate, reached over SSH like an LXC
  box, with the sshpiper gateway, default-deny NetworkPolicy, CSI storage, and
  `nvidia.com/gpu` passthrough. Selected at runtime via `--runtime=k8s` (no
  recompile). End-to-end validated on `kind`; 5-minute local bring-up in
  [docs/KIND-QUICKSTART.md](docs/KIND-QUICKSTART.md). See also
  [docs/K8S-AGENT-BOX-RUNTIME-DESIGN.md](docs/K8S-AGENT-BOX-RUNTIME-DESIGN.md).
- **Q2 2026 (in flight)**: `agent-box` MCP, `ssh-config` CLI,
  `expose-port` CLI, demo recording.
- **Q3 2026**: `agent-box` tier-2 (MCP Roots, background process
  management), demo-driven docs and examples.
- **Q4 2026**: OSS v1.0 cut — stable API surface, contribution
  guide.

- Check [existing issues and PRs](https://github.com/footprintai/Containarium/issues).
- Add tests for new features.
- Update docs if user-visible behavior changes.
